# Run the Application

**CHECK THE SAMPLE FOLDER FOR DEMO FILES. FILES SHOULD BE UPLOADED IN THE SAME FORMAT**

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app is built using **React (Vite)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Router**.
Node.js should be installed in your system.

## Use of Local Storage

- Any file you upload is saved in local storage.
- The data after allotment is saved in local storage to avoid running the same algorithm multiple times. This also makes it easy to restart the app without losing any data.

## Important Instructions

1. **File Format**: Ensure the file format matches exactly as shown in the Problem Statement.
2. **Column Headings**: Column headings should be named the same and in the same sequence.
3. **Error Handling**: If any error occurs during allotment, check the console tab for the error message. (A notification feature may be added soon to display errors more easily.)
4. If the dashboard doesn't appear for a long time after clicking the **PROCEED** button, check the console tab or `allotmentAlgo.js` file.
5. Clicking the **HOSTEL** icon in the top left corner will take you to the input page.
6. Clicking the **RESET** button on the input page will immediately clear all related files from local storage. No confirmation dialogue will appear.
7. The **Room** tab has two views: **TABULAR** and **GRID**.
8. If everything runs smoothly, **ALLOTTED** should be written on the input page.
9. If you exceed the capacity of the hostels, unallocated members will be mentioned in the **teams** tab.
10. You can download the final output file from the **teams** section.
11. If any space is vacant after allotment check that in Roms Section.
12. Almost whole app is responsive. Some components are yet to be updated for improved responsiveness.
13. Every data shown is extracted from **allotment** data only.
